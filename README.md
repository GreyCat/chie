# Chie

Chie is Ruby implementation of data-driven, document- and
transaction-based object-relationship management system (ORM).

## Why another ORM?

To put it simply, most traditional web applications run in a fixed
structure of database. That's what traditional ORMs emphasize and
that's what "M" (the Model) stands for in MVC paradigm: one gets
roughly 1-to-1 mapping from tables in one's database to fixed classes
(that wrap these tables) as "models".

That's the familiar example in ActiveRecord:

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :vendor
    end

    class Vendor < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :products
    end

The field list (mapped to accessor object methods here) would be
derived from database here, but note that:

* relations ("associations" in terms of ActiveRecord) are basically
  hard-coded in the model
* one doesn't have any direct methods to add / remove fields in
  run-time; fields are typically created by migrations ran during
  installation phase of the project

It's ok for most typical applications, but some applications require
their databases to be more dynamic: for example, if one wants to have
multiple (thousands) of tables for different kinds of products, each
sporting a couple of dozens of searchable (=indexed) attributes.
